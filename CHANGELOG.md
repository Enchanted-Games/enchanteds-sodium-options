# 1.1.0

- Updated to support Sodium 0.8.3
- Added tr_tr translations (thanks to Arcdashckr on GitHub!)
- Added a Shaderpacks button in the top right of the video settings screen when Iris is installed
- Option values now show in tooltips. Fixes issues where it was impossible to tell the value of an option if its text was too long

- Fixed some mods appearing in the video settings screen despite having no options. This happened when a mod registered an option overlay but no other options with Sodiums config api
