# Enchanted's Sodium Options

Enchanted's Sodium Options replaces Sodium's video settings screen with one that matches the aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft more closely.

![Other mods that use Sodium's config system are supported by this mod](meta/images/mods.png)

## Features
- Supports all mods that use Sodium's configuration system
- Colours in the video settings screen can be disabled
- Alt + P keybind to open the default Sodium video settings screen if needed

## Supported Versions
- I will keep this mod updated to the latest version of Sodium
- This mod will not be backported to previous versions of Minecraft or Sodium due to Sodium lacking a proper config api in versions before `0.8`
- Forks of Sodium won't be supported by this mod
